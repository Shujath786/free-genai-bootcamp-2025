               SENTENCE STRUCTURE 

               [Subject] [verb to be (implied in Arabic)] [adjective] [preposition] [definite noun phrase]

               CLUES AND CONSIDERATIONS

               - Arabic often uses adjectives after the noun they describe.  
               - The phrase "the other side" might need you to think about direction or position.  
               - No direct verb "is" in Arabic—it's implied.  

               Give it a try!

          You're close, but let’s break down what you actually wrote:  

          - **"aleushb" (الوشب)**: This sounds like a mispronunciation of **"العشب" (al-ʿushb)** for "the grass."  
          - **"akthar khudratan" (أكثر خضرةً)**: Good job here! It means "greener."  
          - **"ealaa aljanib alakhir" (على الجانب الآخر)**: Nice work! It means "on the other side."  
          - **"min alsiyaj" (من السياج)**: Perfect for "of the fence."  

          ### Adjusted Attempt  
          Try: **"العشب أكثر خضرةً على الجانب الآخر من السياج"** *(al-ʿushb akthar khuḍratan ʿala al-jānib al-ākhar min as-siyāj)*.

     <user:input>
          alushb 'akthar khudratan ealaa aljanib alakhir min alsiyaj
     </user:input>

     <assistant:output>
          Much better! Now you've written: "العشب أكثر خضرةً على الجانب الآخر من السياج".

          Interpretation:
          This correctly says: "The grass is greener on the other side of the fence."

          You fixed the initial mistake with "العشب" (al-ʿushb), and your structure is solid.
