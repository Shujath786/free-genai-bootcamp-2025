This strategy outlines the architecture for deploying and fine-tuning an AI model for an Arabic language educational portal.
The approach prioritizes performance, cost efficiency, compliance with data privacy regulations, and high-quality educational content delivery.

## Functional Requirements

The company has decided to self-host AI models and related services due to:

Availability of high-performance hardware capable of supporting large-scale computations.

Cost benefits over managed services, particularly in long-term scalability.

The primary focus is to to create an experience that is effective and affordable for the users with emphasis on Text-to-Speech and Speech-to-Text requirements unique to the Arabic language. 

## Assumptions

  We are assuming that the Open-source LLM that we choose will be powerful enough to run on hardware with an investment of 10-15K.


## Data Strategy

  Curated open-source Arabic educational materials.
  
  Licensed content from reputable academic publishers.
  
  Copyright Clearance – Ensures all content usage adheres to legal requirements.

  Educational Appropriateness Assessment – Validates the relevance and pedagogical value.

  Maintain detailed documentation of data sources and usage rights.

## Considerations

We're considering JAIS for its open-source flexibility and extensive training data, supporting 30 billion parameters and provides accurate Arabic grammar, syntax, and vocabulary explanations, making it suitable for learners at all levels.
